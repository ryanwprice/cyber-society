Google shut down Google Plus (Google+) for its external users in 2018, but this social medium was used by Googlers (Google employees) to raise havoc from 2015 to 2018 (Carmen, 2018). This story of Google’s tumultuous HR years relates to the story of Frankenstein (Monteiro, 2019). Google has an extensive internal social network used by its employees, where free speech is encouraged to allow a sense of belonging. At one point, this social network could only be celebrated, but the monster got out of hand, and now has a lasting effect on Google’s work environment (Tiku, 2019). 

At the beginning, Googlers were proud of their position because, out of the top tech companies, they were the good guys. ‘Don’t be evil’ was one of their internal slogans. Coworkers protested immigration bans together. Everyone had a voice. Clearly, Google cares about people and their diversities. While Google boasted its diversity and inclusion, the numbers did not lie. As of 2017, 80 percent of employees were male, 56 percent were white, and 41 percent were Asian (Tiku, 2019).  

When the majority feels slighted by talks of diversity, the same internal social media, that promoted individualism, diversity and inclusion, was used to express this group’s sentiments. One individual known as Damore must have thought his Google+ page does not allow enough optics for his message’s gravity (Tiku, 2019). He circulated his ‘anti-diversity manifesto’ through two internal mailing lists causing it to go viral within Google (Tiku, 2019). “In the memo, Damore wrote that hiring practices aimed to increase diversity ‘can effectively lower the bar’ at Google” (Tiku, 2019, para. 24).

Companies with internal social platforms deal with the same issues the internet invites. Moreover, there comes a direct risk: negatively impacting one’s job. Unfortunately, who is reprimanded and who is not, depends on the company’s values. Similar to whose content is flagged, removed or banned online depends on who manages the social platform (Monteiro, 2019). Prior to reading this article, I thought Google was an unbiased and fair company. At the end of the day, Google values innovation, and they are willing to accept the consequences for fostering innovation at all costs (Tiku, 2019).

Google managers took to their Google+ pages to show support for women in the wake of Damore’s memo. Googler Liz Fong-Jones had done the same, except her post about denying a platform to individuals like Damore was leaked externally to Vox Popoli, a blog ran by a far-right activist (Tiku, 2019). Much like the story of Ivanna’s phone: Sasha, a young adult, took the phone and Evan, Ivanna’s friend, started a website to find Ivanna’s phone. Because Sasha had taunted Ivanna and Evan with returning the phone, Evan’s readers demonized and attacked Sasha, similar to the personal attacks of racial and sexual slurs Fong-Jones faced from Vox Popoli’s readers (Shirky, 2008; Tiku, 2019). Interestingly, Fong-Jones taking a stance at work, lead to her digital self, her personal image, and professional image being simultaneously damaged.

It was ironic, yet intentional, that once Fong-Jones called for the platform to be removed from certain people, their army showed its strength by tearing her down (Tiku, 2019). The irony is without a platform, subsequently without digital relevancy, people like Damore would lose their digital army and feel silenced. Furthermore, it would mirror how visible minorities feel in real life. Damore would feel invisible at work and devalued. This is what Google is trying to avoid as they celebrate their geniuses regardless of their rash actions. For example, Andy Rubin, the cofounder of the Google start-up Android, was later reported to coerce a female Googler into performing oral sex in a hotel room. After Google’s investigations found the story to be true, they sent Rubin off with a 90 million dollar exit package (Tiku, 2019). 

The idea that social networks allow people to feel heard is the reason Google and other corporations see internal social networks as a great idea (Millar, 2015). Obviously, it needs refinement, rules and ethics; however, this is a dystopian discussion because the same majority that has economic and political power in real life, have online power because they manage these major social platforms. Once this phenomenon mixes with one’s job, workers have to adapt to each social media, from Facebook and Instagram, to their job’s equivalent. Soon creating a digital self may be mandatory, if not for personal use but for work. The pressure to constantly evaluate who surveys that medium will be a part of work stress.

Senior management tried to remain neutral but outlined that Damore’s actions imposed on other Googlers’ abilities to express dissent. At the same time, many were fired for criticizing Damore’s memo (Tiku, 2019). Much like the message of Shirky’s article was the power of the online group, Googlers had to crowdsource as issues got worse (Shirky, 2008). It only took one leak during this time for Googlers to decide that enlisting the many, or crowdsourcing, was fair game for either side. Several far-right blogs continued to receive leaks of targeted employees. There was a collage with full names, profile pictures, and Twitter bios. The targeted few were mostly LGBTQ2S+ people of colour. Unfortunately, Google stated that the labour right, protected concerted activity, prevented the company from reprimanding the leakers. Ironically this is the same labour right that allows employees to organize without retaliation from their employer. So, the targeted few began organizing (Tiku, 2019).  
 
First Fong-Jones invited a speaker to educate Googlers about protected concerted activity. Then, when Damore’s class-action lawsuit against Google for discriminating against white people, Asians, men, and conservatives caused 169 Googlers’ personal information to be posted online and subsequently face harassment, Fong-Jones took the issue to the press. Furthermore, her internal petition for a safer workplace through better moderation of mailing lists and enforcing rules against doxing coworkers received 2,600 signatures (Tiku, 2019; Shirky, 2011). 

Fong-Jones’ actions became a how-to crowdsource to cause change at Google. When Google signed the Project Maven contract to develop AI for drones with the department of defence, Googlers roared. Involvement in war business directly contradicts Google’s ‘don’t be evil’ moral. Organizers, like Meredith Whittaker, loudly expressed their opinions on the internal social media, with a petition gaining over 3,000 signatures, and leveraged external media and press, causing Google to abandon the contract. The tensions between executives and ‘internal activists’ have not returned to normal, as the leaks continue, and organizers continue to leverage media (Tiku, 2019). 
 
While Google is a tech leader, it is also a company with dozens of employees. Google saw their Frankenstein social network quickly go rogue. It was created to foster engagement and a sense of belonging between employees, not force Google’s hands. While Google remains a for-profit company looking to make strategic moves, they must always acknowledge the power of the many: not just consumers, but Googlers too. Furthermore, this is an example of how the many can crowdsource against major companies and their employers, keeping the powerful accountable by their own Frankenstein.
