image-description: A picture of many different workers heading towards their workplace in Asia was manipulated in order to view people as profiles. Men are highlighted in blue boxes while women are highlighted in pink boxes, while also being told what age frame they fall under. It is our job to convey our digital self in an appropriate manner in order to secure our digital privacy as best as we can. In the eyes of big corporations, we are nothing more than a number they can sell stuff to. Seeing people as profiles instead of physical people is exactly what I am trying to convey in my editorial.

## How well are you displaying and taking care of your private online information?

Do you ever feel like you are being tracked? With all the advancements in network security technology, they could pick out your favourite colour just based on information you put online and even track your license plate from down the street. In the articles I have chosen, the authors and myself highlight intriguing points regarding network surveillance technology and how it impacts our everyday life. Things like how "Flock Safety" has developed an automatic license plate reader and how people are increasingly feeling like they have less privacy. I also highlighted a recent example where Facebook users had their information stolen and was used without them knowing. These topics are all relevant to both the course content and to our everyday life because we must stay updated on the latest information in order to sustain what little privacy we have left and display our digital self in an appropriate manner. There are some things that just shouldn’t be shared with the general public. We want our privacy and we don’t want to have to act like robots in public or online. Although these advancements are good for stopping crimes, they are creating a negative atmosphere for individuals.


## License Plate Readers


If you are not already scared about network surveillance cameras tracking, then you should probably start to worry. In this article, Elizabeth Joh raises an interesting issue, "But what happens when you fuse startup culture, artificial intelligence, and fearful neighbours? Call it the rise of networked vigilante surveillance. And we’re not prepared for it” (Joh, 2019). A venture company called “Flock Safety” is an Atlantic based company that has created security cameras with automatic license plate readers. Even if one person in a neighbourhood has this technology, they provide a detailed map of anyone’s cars whereabouts all from a license plate reader. This task could take any ordinary person hours or days to track down, but this software completes it in seconds. Like many other companies claim, you own your own data, but do you really, and how good is their security on this information? Things like cameras, cloud storage, and software that allow quick identification of license plates are all advantages that come with this technology. Even with one paranoid neighbour, the entire street is under the surveillance of this camera and with what permission? I know myself, I don’t even like being in random people’s Snapchat video or pictures, let alone having my license plate recorded. If I’m not causing any destruction, what gives you the right to record my license plate down?


## Digital Privacy


We talk about the "Digital Self" in class quite frequently and we sill soon be discussing the topic of "Digital Privacy” and I believe they are intertwined. In week 8, we will discuss "Digital Privacy” and the article by Mayer, A. and Pereira, M. displays this very well. O’Neil shares an interesting point about using public wifi, "Something else I’d never really considered was how vulnerable I was making myself by using public Wi-Fi networks... Sure, I might save a few bucks on my wireless bill, but is it worth the risk of giving third-party corporations or even malicious hackers access to my data?” (Mayer & Pereria, 2014). This is something millions of people, including myself, unknowingly do so they can save some gigabytes of their own personal data. If you walk into any Starbucks or Tim Hortons across Canada, you will see this. I myself am victim of doing this due to the fact I am always over my data limit, but after reading this, I won’t be doing that anymore. Instead of just scrolling to the bottom of the wifi login tab, people should start to actually read that “user agreement” to see what they are really agreeing to. Just not too long ago, Facebook got in serious trouble for having the personal data of many Facebook users stolen. It was reported that the Facebook-Cambridge scandal, "was a major political scandal in early 2018 when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of peoples’ Facebook profiles without their consent and used it for political advertising purposes” (Anderson, 2018). I’ve been using Facebook ever since I was in Gr. 6 and for many of us, it was our first form of social media. Facebook is one of the biggest social media platforms in the world but clearly their security is not at the same level as other platforms and they got in trouble because of it. We wonder why we have ads for stuff after searching or talking about something for less than a minute, this is why, our information is being tossed around all over the web.


## Personal Connection


I believe that the topics of "Digital Privacy" and "Digital Self" are very relevant in my life because network digital surveillance is everywhere in our world, although you shouldn’t feel you need to act a certain way in public/online, many of us do. Almost every square inch of our world is being recorded by some sort of camera, and then uploaded into a database. I remember when I was in Gr. 9, my friend Dylan and I were walking home and the Google Maps van drove by us and we thought it was so cool because we ended up being on the map for that given street, but now looking back at it, we're both like, “Wow, not only can we see this, so can everyone in the entire world” and to be honest, it’s scary. Companies like Google update their pictures quite frequently due to the changing world, but they will always have that picture in their database under their 2013 file. Not once were Dylan or I asked if we were okay with being on the Google Maps picture. It just seems like the idea of asking permission before taking pictures/videos of the public has gone out the window and privacy is shrinking faster than ever before.


## Conclusion


In conclusion, I believe that myself and many other people have a justifiable reason to be worried about their lack of privacy in our society. I brought up the fact that this is very relevant to our course and everyone’s daily life due to the fact that cameras and network hackers are all around us and we talk all about the digital self and digital privacy in our course, so not only do you need to be aware of how you display yourself online, but also in public. We have companies like Flock Safety that when investigating car thefts, they can gain access into certain accounts and track which cars have been up and down the street during the time of the crime. Also, Lauren O’Neil sheds some light on public wifi networks that once we connect to them, just by sending an email we allow big corporations and malicious hackers easy access to all of our information that we didn’t even know they could access. Furthermore, as the owner of a major social media company, Mark Zuckerberg cannot let the personal information of several hundred thousands of accounts be stolen and used for another app. Digital privacy is no joke, with major advancements to security cameras and digital tracking comes personal information being leaked and requesting permission to be recorded becoming obsolete. Are you prepared for this?
