This is not an article that doubts if _"Attack on Titan"_ relates to any country’s totalitarianism or judge the creator’s political stand, I just want to express some personal cognitions of sympathy after I have watched all three seasons of _"Attack on Titan"_.

The fear of the titans in _"Attack on Titan"_ starts with their appearances. They are like human, but never human. They have hair, facial features, head, and limbs, but these features are distorted and elongated. Their heights are from 3 meters to 50 meters. It has something to do with "The Uncanny Valley". "The uncanny valley is a common unsettling feeling people experience when androids (humanoid robots) and audio/visual simulations closely resemble humans in many respects but are not quite convincingly realistic." (Margaret Rouse) The titans use creepy postures to run; sick sounds to roar; vacant eyes to stare but high speed and bloodiness ways to kill humans. They do not need to eat humans to survive, they do it for fun, kill for the sake of killing which put them on the opposite side of human and gives Eren(chief actor) reasons that killing every one of it without any morality standards.

The fear increases when titans are learning. 3D maneuver gear (Rittai kidō sōchi) is created for approaching the titans and cutting their napes to killing these huge monsters. "Even though the Spiderteens(teams of people using 3D maneuver gears to kill titans) are fast and agile, it only takes one Titan to raise its arm and grab the wires, or place a well-timed chomp for a painful death to lay ahead." (Ruben Ferdinand) Thirty percent of the recruits die during their first battle.

Even the chief actor Eren, lost his right foot when he first meets titans.	He watched most of the recruits in his class was being eaten and there is nothing he can do. The war is cruel. He shouts out that he will kill every single titan for the revenge of his mother, however, he can not protect anyone even himself. Therefore, this anime is not about the powerful main characters who always see through the enemy's plot to win, it reveals the real brutal war and the deaths are inevitable.

When it comes to war, people separate into different parts? ‘Military Police’, ‘Garrison’, and ‘Survey Corp’, three different parts of army power. ‘Military Police’ is the most corruption, yet, it requires the recruits must be top 10. When the ‘Survey Corp’ is fighting titans out of the wall at the first line, ‘Military Police’ is staying at the center of the wall and playing cards, drinking and selling state supplies. 

What causes this situation? The royal family. ‘Military Police’ becomes the army for despotism use of the king.
After Maria Wall’s fallen, the refugees pour into the capital which causes the lacking of food and battles for domains. The royal family tells ‘Military Police’ to forcibly recruited a quarter of a million refugees to form an army called liberators and let them return to the walls of Maria where the giants have invaded and the result is they all die. The royal family has given this humanitarian crisis a lofty label of patriotism. They emphasized the glory of sacrifice; for the greater good of human survival. A soldier who knows nothing but ease is lost before a fight.

At the same time, the regimental commander of ‘Survey Corp’ Erwin Smith gives out his final speech to recruits when they fight the monkey titan: ‘you will die, and your deaths will be in vain. But you must die for this one plan to maybe work. shinzou wo sasageyo!(sacrifice your hearts)’(Ruben Ferdinand)He does not lie to the soldiers anymore and it was so sincere. He will die at the first line and you recruits must give up your dream and die. Your sacrifice may be meaningless, but you must do it. Although Erwin's words may sound outrageous, it is for the sake of all mankind. He abandons these beautiful words such as humankind will remember you; your death will change the future; your death will be the glory."If mountains of corpses are required to succeed and to emerge victorious over an enemy who will stop at nothing to eradicate you, is that then not something you just have to begrudgingly accept?"(Ruben Ferdinand) That is what Erwin thinks and how he sees sacrifices.

The recruits know that they can't run away from the monkey titan, they are afraid of death and thinking they are going to die soon. But they still ride on the horses, crying and shouting rush at the monkey titan. Even the monkey titan is thinking that why they are charging so hard when they know this is the end of their life? It gives time for Levi Heichou(the best titan killer in the world) to get closer to the monkey titan. It may fail, it may succeed, the recruits will no longer notice. Human kinds will not remember all of their names probably, and their death means nothing, but they truly give Levi a chance to fight monkey titan.
I was crying when I review this scene. My nose is still sour and I had to make an aside: the director really finished this fiction so well that me who had never experienced a war, choke up as I have been there to feel their despair and sadness. That's why I chose this article.
War is cruel, bloody and downright hypocritical.
Death is always so far away from us that we may not understand the national pride of Japan and the glory of sacrifice. The _“Attack on Titan”_ has given us one faction: death equals glory, I have guarded all mankind and another faction of truth: this moment of death is meaningless, but it worths the risk. We seem like we have learned to let go of the dreams and hopes of ours, and perhaps this moments’ meaningless deaths will serve the country. The deaths of recruits may not bring and chances about the end of the human race in the future, but since it can be a deadly blow to the enemy, there is nothing wrong with losing.
