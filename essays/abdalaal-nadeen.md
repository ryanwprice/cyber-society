This editorial will be focused on the Vox article “China paid Facebook and Twitter to help spread anti-Muslim propaganda” by Sigal Samuel.  The article explores how: “the US-based social media giants have been enabling Chinese state-owned media to spread misinformation about the camps,” investigations by the Intercept and BuzzFeed News revealed (Samuel, 2019). Further, the article goes to explain how they responded to these claims and how they plan to move forward. My perspective on this issue completely aligns with the perspective of the author that states that these social media platforms should no longer accept advertisement money from state-controlled media outlets such as in China. In general, when a minority group is going up against a figure with endless access to resources; their side of the story hits the public sooner and with a greater impact than their proponent.

Entrepreneur and philanthropist, known for the founding of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg argues that Facebook is a ‘tech company’ and a ‘platform’, not a publisher. (Mishcastillo, 2018) However, according to the Pew Research Center; studies show that these days more than 50% of people get their news from social media, and in the United States it is more than 60%  (Gottfried, J & Shearer, E. 2017I believe Facebook needs to take more responsibility as a news provider. Specifically, in terms of the Vox article ‘China paid Facebook and Twitter to help spread anti-Muslim propaganda’. I believe Twitter took a step in the right direction by denouncing they will no longer accept advertising money from state-controlled media outlets. However, Facebook still has a way to go. Sigal Samuel stated that; “Facebook executives were still dragging their feet about combatting misinformation more broadly. The company says it wants to remain ‘neutral on deepfakes’. (Samuel, 2019) As discussed in the course content deepfakes, is a distorted or manipulated photo or video that make it look like someone said or did something that never actually had occurred (Price, 2019). Facebook has decided to keep accepting paid ads from state-controlled media and often times depend on outside experts to flag problematic posts. They then will decide whether or not they agree with, before taking action to keep the post up or to take it down. Although, the main issue with this is that by the time all procedures are followed through, said posts may have already caused detrimental harm (Duan, S. 2010).

I believe that there has currently been a rise in the spreading of fake news and the censoring of public information by authoritarian states.  Fake news is the presentation of unverified facts, usually created to advance a political agenda, make profit, and or mischief (Caulfield, Sept 9, 2019). Author and futurist, Jamais Cascio once stated that “the crisis we face about the ‘truth’ and reliable facts is predicated less on the ability to get people to believe the ‘wrong’ thing as it is on the ability to get people to ‘doubt’ the right thing” (Anderson, & Rainie, 2018). This is proven to be true every time we go on twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. Many people today naively believe everything they see on social media. The rise in the spreading of fake news, creates profit for the social media platforms and control over what information the people get to know (Ethics in the News, 2019). Like the saying goes ‘whoever wins the war gets to write the history’ in this day and age it’s a race for whoever can get more attraction on their social media posts and general public support to be able to write the narrative.  In the assigned reading, The Political Power of Social Media: Technology, the Public Sphere, and Political Change further explains that: “Authoritarian states are increasingly shutting down their communications grids to deny dissidents the ability to coordinate in real time and broadcast documentation of an event.” (Samuel, 2019). The reading goes on to use China and Bahrain as an example.  In China, the Chinese Web service is very intricate because its goal as a state is minimize open and free access to their information. Thus, they “encourage operators of Chinese Web services to censor their users and users to censor themselves” (Shirky, C. 2016). While, in Bahrain the government “banned Google Earth after an annotated map of the royal family's annexation of public land began circulating”.

The paper on "Violence" in advertising by Duan, Shan Shan explains that the violence in adverting, is the “undesirable phenomenon in advertising who ignores the respect for the rights of consumers, makes use of the strengths of money and media, and last takes advantage of these measures forcing consumers to receive information” (Duan, S. 2010). I believe, social media has changed the way people interact, discover and share information. Unfortunately, they have often misled the very same audience who keep them in business. As the world has shifted into the technological era, more and more companies and politicians have been ditching traditional marketing strategies, to instead begin campaigning to their audience through social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter). Fake news travels fast and makes a big impact; especially with a leading amount of impressionable young audiences exposed to these sites. I believe the honest truth should be deemed more important than a payout.

The Vox article “China paid Facebook and Twitter to help spread anti-Muslim propaganda” by Sigal Samuel, taught me that fake news and the censoring of news is an existential crisis that we are now facing in result to actions made by the social media sites. Further, I believe that Facebook needs to take a less anemic stand and change its policies and regulations. My opinion is further emphasized by the course text when it was stated that, “manipulation has consequences across almost all domains, from law enforcement and national security through to scientific publishing, politics, media, and advertising” (Price, 2019). I truly believe the public should be given all the true and honest facts and then be left to decide what they feel about it and where they stand.
