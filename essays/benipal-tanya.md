I sometimes go through the Youtube rabbit hole and end up watching a lot of old music videos. And while spiralling down (this time), I came across the Green Day music video of the song *Holiday [Live]* and was surprised at how engaged the audience was. Everyone was singing along to the song while waving their arms in the air, and it was interesting to see how different the concert experience has become. 

It seems like years ago when people would fully enjoy their experience at a show, and now, the only thing people want to do is record parts of the concert on their smartphones to share on social media, and/or prove that they attended. 

It may be the climate in which we are assimilated, where we need imperial evidence that proves our attendance, or maybe we just don’t trust other people. But, concerts are a different experience now.

According to the article titled *Turn it Off: Cell Phones and Concert Culture* by HuffPost “[A] T-Mobile [study stated], 47 percent of any given audience text others during a show, while 32 percent engage in social media during a show” (Silva, 2017).

As a quick test, I went onto my Instagram to look through some of my friends’ feeds (keep in mind, these are people I know from high school, many of which are not major music junkies) and saw many photos or videos taken from an array of concerts. One interesting thing caught in the pictures was that many other smartphones were also pointed towards the stage; proving that people record the event and post pictures or videos to commemorate the event or to just post something to shows their attendance.

Many people often use social media as their way of storytelling. It used to be: enjoy a concert, talk about your experience with people who missed out, and reminisce with your fellow attendees. Now everyone posts about their experience immediately for instant gratification. Instant gratification provided through likes and comments that make a person feel important and interesting — just for attending. 

But one problem with recording the show is that people tend to forget the actual event and only remember the version caught on the camera/smartphone. 

“Psychologist Linda Henkel discovered a ‘photo-taking impairment effect’, where reliance on photo-taking devices leads to less memory of the items or moments you take photos of. Depending on this ‘external memory aid’ allows you to transfer all your efforts to remember the show to a memory card” (Silva, 2017).

So just by having your phone or camera with you, subconsciously allows your brain to remember less. Therefore, chances are, you will not enjoy the show as much as someone fully immersed in the concert experience.

This also goes further than just recording concerts. For example, looking through the childhood photos that your parents took. You may look at a picture and have a memory connected to it. 

But is that an actual memory, or a “fake” memory you’ve sculpted around the photo taken. 

“So many of our memories are informed by images of moments we don't actually remember” (NPR Staff, 2014).

And while our parents should be the gatekeepers for those memories, “Those parents at the park taking all those photos are actually paying less attention to the moment, […] because they're focused on the act of taking the photo” (NPR Staff, 2014).

It’s almost like photos are now our memories, because "As soon as you hit 'click' on that camera, it's as if you've outsourced your memory,” (NPR Staff, 2014).

This is why people need to live in the moment when attending concerts. So they don’t forget the event that they’ve spent hundreds of dollars on. Getting a picture is great, but don’t let that mission deter you from enjoying the show.

Even Beyoncé said “You’ve gotta seize the moment! Put that damn camera down!” (Silva, 2017). 

Another problem is that when you take your phone out to record, you’re not only affecting yourself but others around you. Cellphones are distracting and when you raise that huge phone into the air, chances are you are disrupting someone else’s view and experience. 

Personally, if some in my immediate vicinity were raising their phone to record the entire show, I would be very annoyed.

In some way, I understand the desire to record and capture memories. You want to be able to share your experiences with people who missed out and get them equally as excited for the topic/person/people of interest.

“We take photos and video of concerts to show off to our friends, to tell them that we had the ability to attend a concert. According to a Ticketmaster and Live Nation study, men and women between 18-34 (that’s us!) make up nearly half of all concert crowds” (Silva, 2017).

Selfish intent or not, people want to share their experiences with others — even if those in their immediate surroundings don’t appreciate it. 

People also want to prove that they are big fans of the musician or band. People will buy merchandise, share “appreciation posts” on social media, and post about concerts or shows they’ve attended — to prove that they’re fans of an artist.

It’s kind of like when you wear a sports jersey and someone tells you to name five players from the team. In order to be accepted into an identity group associated with that artist/band/team, you need to prove you’re a fan.

Because today, you can only be a fan when you spend money on the artist. The more you invest, the higher your fan status.

“We are presented with the view of fans as (specialist) consumers, whose fandom is expressed through keeping up with the new release of [music], books, comics, and videos” (Grinnell College, n.d.).

So, someone who keeps up with everything related to the musician(s), goes to concerts, has a fan page for the artist, and wears merchandise may be considered a bigger fan than someone who just appreciates the music. This concept has been around for decades when fans would test others with knowledge and trivia — which would then determine “real” fan status. 

Today, people are obsessed with recording everything and sharing their experiences on social media. 

It’s one of the reasons why “vlogs” or “video blogs” on YouTube are one of the most popular types of videos. It’s essentially a narrative of someone’s day-to-day lifestyle. People are sharing their lives on the internet to preserve their memories and have other people enjoy their experiences as well. 

Storytelling is so important, it’s a phenomenon that has been around since the stone ages. The concept has stayed the same, but the medium in which the story is told has evolved. From verbal narratives to printed stories, and now to digital media. 

Getting your story out is important, sharing your memories with people is both exciting and nostalgic. 

But please, for the love of God, do not record everything at a concert. 

Enjoy the show. Live in the moment.
