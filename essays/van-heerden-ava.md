# Should Data Companies Profit Off Your Medical Information?

It comes as no surprise that big tech companies use our online data to make a profit by selling our personal information to other companies. The real debate now is where we draw the line with our privacy when it comes to our personal health information. Big tech and business companies are mining our data, and our medical information is next on their lists. These large companies promise more health care devices and breakthroughs with the use of our data, but the mining of this information also comes with more sinister risks. Medical information should be kept confidential because everyone has the right to keep that personal information private; it should not be sold for profit; and there are ethical concerns that this breach of privacy may lead to classist and racist health care provision in the future.  

Firstly, in regard to health care privacy, “Privacy isn’t just about remaining anonymous or keeping things secret, it’s about the right to be able to keep those things secret”. (Price, 2019). Everyone hopes to keep a private profile online, but the reality is that it’s almost impossible to keep things from being tracked because everything online is being collected. Within the journal Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through Research, they define privacy in the context of online health information and data collection as, “Privacy is concerned with the collection, storage, and use of personal information, and examines whether data can be collected in the first place, as well as the justifications, if any, under which data collected for one purpose can be used for another (secondary) purpose.” (Nass, 2009). This definition is very clear about the boundaries of privacy and through this explanation we can understand when privacy is breached. We all hope that we can keep some things hidden, but with big tech companies selling every trace of our digital footprint, it’s almost impossible today to keep anything secret. Our privacy is breached by these companies, and because of this we face the possibility of identity theft and fraud. 

Secondly, in the article, You Don’t Want Facebook Involved With Your Health Care by Kirsten Ostherr, she says that big tech and business companies are mining our data to provide health-related advances in technology and better service in the medical field, but she warns that these advances come with more menacing risks. She says that, “It will make us venerable to increased surveillance, digital profiling, and manipulation in the most intimate of settings: our health care encounters”. (Ostherr, 2019). Through data mining and collection big tech and data companies can see what the World Health Organization calls the “social determinates of health”. This means that outside companies can track “the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life.” (World Heath Organization, 2018). This definition of “social detriments of health” encompass everything about us, and through our online presence these big tech companies can now track every aspect of our lives that was mentioned. Through our online footprint, these companies can better track and quantify our lifestyle and risk factors regarding our health. Through the data collected, investors, banks, and insurance providers could potentially base whether, and how, they support you based on your personal online data. It would be in their best interest to decide to grant a potential loan based on tangible data that spells out exactly how much Netflix you watch, what you search on the web, your relationship status, how much you exercise, what medications you take, and where you spend your disposable income. This intrusive scenario could become reality if the large data companies were able to capitalize on health care information.

The breaches of online privacy, especially with our health care information, may lead to classist and racist health care provision. Through data mining big tech companies can see patient risk trajectories, meaning that they are better able to predict who is at risk. For example, they are better able to know when someone is at risk of a stroke by tracking their online medical data. This advancement in technology may sound like a good thing, but with it also comes risks. Online algorithms do not have the ability to factor in or out contributing factors to someone’s health status or risk assessment. Some of the classifications that would affect the health and wellness algorithms that would be harmful to certain populations that include; “social determinants of health categories like race, housing, and financial history,” (Ostherr, 2019). If data algorithms calculated health risks and then the amount of insurance granted is based entirely on that collected data, some people groups would pay more based on social class and race. Ostherr goes on to say that, “the data are neither neutral nor objective.” (Ostherr, 2019). The danger of big data mining companies selling personal information and then these online algorithms shaping our health care outcomes is a very real possibility, and it has already begun. Companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft have all begun looking into ways to capitalise on the health care industry to create personalized health care analytics. We need to keep our health care information private, not only for our own benefit and privacy, but to keep health care provisions from being granted based on classist or racist algorithms. 

In conclusion, health care information should be kept confidential because everyone has the right to privacy online, especially in regard to personal medical information. Health care information should not be sold for profit, as it is selling data that makes up people’s lives and could be used for harm like in cases of fraud. Lastly, online information that is linked to health care should not be sold by big tech companies because the use of that information may lead to classist and racist health care decisions in the future. Because of these three reasons I believe that big technology companies should not have access to our health care information, even if there are new potentially beneficial technologies that come out of the use of this information.
