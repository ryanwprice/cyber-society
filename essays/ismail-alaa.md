Since its founding in 2004, Facebook has been at the centre of many conversations regarding social media and human interaction. At times, Facebook is blamed for negatively affecting human communication, while other times, it is praised for how it connects us. One instance in which people were conflicted about how Facebook influenced people was when the ‘empathy’ buttons were introduced. The buttons received backlash by people like Roman Krznaric. In his article, _Facebook Doesn’t Understand That There's No One-Clock Shortcut to Empathy_, Krznaric’s main concern is that these ‘empathy’ buttons will become a replacement to genuine action in social and political situations, decreasing our emotional literacy, and our reactivity to political issues (2015).

To begin, Krznaric’s main cause of worry is that the empathy buttons will affect our communicative abilities, especially our emotional communication. Although one can see how Krznaric relates Facebook's emotive buttons with the demise of human empathy, Jessica Helfand shows that this is untrue. Facebook’s new empathy buttons are a step closer to improved communication and not a step away, as Krznaric claims. In an essay titled, _Deathquette: A Design Problem_, Helfand question how companies like Facebook can help people express sadness, sympathy, and grief in visual vocabulary, and why they have not done so yet (2014). Krznaric fails to acknowledge that we live in an internet dominated world, that relies on visual language; however, due to the newness of this phenomenon, our visual vocabulary has yet to develop. This, in turn, limits how people can express their emotions as they can only react to tragedy in one way, a thumbs up. Helfand’s, like many others, urged Facebook to come up with a way that allows people to express their feelings through imagery, and so, Facebook complied. Facebook took this limitation which Helfand pointed out as the ‘limitation of icons’ (2014) and transformed it into a language that anyone can understand. They provided people with a variety of ways to communicate certain feelings so that we no longer minimize an event into a ‘like’, but instead show people that we are in fact empathizing with them, sharing their sadness, anger, or love, but instead of using words, we use the new human language: visuals. 

The second problem with the reaction buttons which Krznaric points out is that it opens a door to political slacktivism. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, slacktivism is an activity that uses the internet to support a political or social cause with little to no effort (eg. signing a petition). In this situation, Krznaric fails to acknowledge two things. The first is the benefits ‘reacting’ to a post can have on how far spread it becomes, and the second is the power of Facebook as a whole in the organization of action. Clay Shirky explores the power of ‘reactions’ through the story of Evan, Ivana, and Sasha. In the story, Ivana, a woman who loses her phone in a cab, asks her friend, Evan, to help her find her phone. Evan finds out that the phone was stolen by a teenager named Sasha, who refused to return the phone to Ivana. To bring Sasha to justice, Evan turns to the internet where he builds a website asking the public to help him bring Sasha to justice. In a matter of days, the story becomes part of national and international headlines because people were reacting to the ‘post’. People were not only reacting by liking the page/post, but they were sharing it with friends and colleagues who shared it with their friends and colleagues (Shirky, 2008, p.9). Lawyers, police officers, and many others became people who were ‘reacting’ to the post, helping Evan convince the New York Police Department (NYPD) to change their classification of the case from a ‘lost phone’ case to a ‘stolen phone’ case; thus, the NYPD brought Ivana’s phone back to her. In this case, Evan’s website is a Facebook post, and because of this post, his friend’s phone was given back to her. The story disproves Krznaric’s point that people are just passively reacting to the content they receive. They are actively engaging with it, sharing it from one person to the next until change is brought about. One example in which social media was not an influencer in change, which Krznaric points out, is the UK opening its doors to Syrian refugees because people took to the streets and not because they liked a Facebook post about the plight (2015); however, it was the sharing and liking of pictures like Alan Kurdi and other suffering refugees which evoked the protests. Like in Evan and Sasha’s story, people sharing the photos reached those who were able to act, resulting in change.
 
The second point within his political slacktivism issue which Krznaric disregards is the importance of social media, specifically Facebook, as political tools of organization and communication. Krznaric argues that in cases like the Occupy Movement and the Arab Spring, Facebook did nothing more than inspire people to protest (2015). On the contrary, Blake Hounshell states that Facebook did more than just inspire people to protest. It acted as a tool of organization and mobilization which allowed for the protests to occur in the first place (Hounshell, 2013, p. 2). Clay further builds on this point by stating that Facebook helps disadvantaged groups coordinate protests as it “altered the old limits on size, sophistication, and scope of unsupervised effort,” (Shirky, 2008, p. 21) while also reducing the cost of coordination (Shirky, 2011, p. 6). Nowadays, democracy relies more on the access to conversation than it does on anything else, as conversation is what allows for political engagement, the circulation of information, and public debate (Shirky, 2011, p.5). Social media act as tools of communication which help channel existing motivations (Shirky, 2008, p. 17); thus, social media does not lead to slacktivism by replacing real-world action, as Krznaric claims, but instead, it becomes a tool of coordination, enhancing real-life action. 

All in all, Krznaric seems to overlook the power of Facebook as a tool of social and political communication. He fails to acknowledge the importance of empathy buttons as a step towards the development of visual communication, he undermines the role ‘reacting’ to content plays in generating political action, and he disregards the importance of social media in the organization and communication of political movements. Although one can argue against Krznaric’s points, his worries about the relationship between social media and the way we react to the world are valid. These tools do come with many benefits, but their effectiveness is still questionable. One should keep in mind, however, that the internet has only been around for 30 years, and the first recognized social media site, Six Degree, was only developed 22 years ago. The newness of this platform shows what we have now is far from perfection as every new tool comes with limitations. So, instead of asking how social media has resulted in the demise of human interaction as Krznaric does, we should ask how we can overcome the shortcomings of this fairly new technology to produce improve our social and political interactions.
