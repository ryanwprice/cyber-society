Self-image and social media are two concepts that often go hand in hand. There is still a heated debate on whether the relationship they share is a positive or negative one. A recent topic surrounding these two concepts discusses Likes on social media and the role that they play in the lives of users. The discussion specifically focuses on whether Likes on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram improve or diminish our self-image. Recently Facebook and Instagram have experimented with taking away the user’s ability to see how many Likes a post that does not belong to them receives.  This is an update that will positively impact user’s self-image by allowing them to continue to view their own likes and gain positive feedback from their peers. While at the same time causing users to present a more authentic version of themselves by not being able to view what is most popular.  

## Digital Self

Before we dive too deeply into this debate it is important to first explain the concept of the ‘digital self’.  This concept refers to the persona that a user will portray while on social media (Your Digital Self: How to Present Yourself Online, 2018). For some, this persona is very similar if not the same as who they really are, while others reflect a persona online that they feel will make them the most liked by their peers. For the latter, they choose what to post and what posts to like based on this idea, rather than what they might actually want to post and like.

 A study conducted by Social Cognitive And Affective Neuroscience focused in on this idea and looked into determining the neural correlations of providing feedback on social media through the form of Likes. This study found that “when young people viewed Instagram photos with many Likes, compared with few, they showed greater responses in brain regions associated with reward and visual attention, and were themselves more likely to click Like.” (Sherman, Hernandez, Greenfield, & Dapretto, 2018). This finding shows that the amount of likes a post has is able to influence the online persona an individual has. Taking away the ability to view Likes from social networking sites will force one’s digital self to more closely reflect who they are, and not who they feel those on social media want them to be.
 
## Connection Not Narcissism 

While I agree with the idea of social networking sites such as Instagram and Facebook taking away the ability to view how many Likes a post has received, it is important to continue to allow users to Like posts as well as view the Likes they themselves receive. It is a popular belief that the posts we make on social media, selfies in particular are narcissistic. I believe there has to be more to it, while there may be some narcissism involved in posting a picture of yourself the main reason behind it is to feel connected to those around you. Pamela Rutledge, Ph. D., director of the Media Psychology Research center explains,  "The humanist movement introduced the concept of healthy narcissism, recognizing that some amount of self-love or self-esteem and a realistic appraisal of and appreciation for one’s qualities is necessary for healthy development," (Tucker, 2017). 

 If this is the case that posting on social media and receiving Likes, does translate into self-esteem or approval from others is in fact healthy, it is important that Facebook and Instagram continue to allow the user themselves to view the likes they get, while not allowing others to see this number. By doing this, the user still feels connected to those around them but does not feel the need to compromise their true self in order to receive the most likes possible, or share and Like posts based on the fact that the post has a large number of Likes. 
## Addiction to Social Media 

It is my belief that a user’s ability to receive Likes is important for self-esteem, it is important to also acknowledge the growing issue of social media addiction around the world. This addiction can arise from the satisfaction that is associated with the positive feelings with  receiving Likes from our peers. A study conducted by the Journal of Social psychology found that these addiction rates are between 1.5% and 8.2% in the United States and are continuing to rise (Zivnuska, Carlson, & Harris, 2019). It is my belief that by Facebook and Instagram taking away users ability to view Likes on posts that do not belong to them, social media addiction may actually decrease. This will be done by users not feeling the need to compete to obtain high number of Likes. 
Social media and self-image can have a positive relationship with each other as long as the experimental updates Facebook and Instagram have made become permanent. This update will allow user’s digital self to more closely reflect who they really are while still allowing them to gain satisfaction by receiving likes on their posts. This update will decrease social media addiction while maintaining the benefits social media has to offer.
