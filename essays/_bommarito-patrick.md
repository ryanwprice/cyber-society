As of Saturday, October 5th 2019, the protests in Hong Kong are leading into their fourth month of tension. Demonstrations against the government and calling for the solidification of democracy, and against the threat posed by the technology-driven authority of China, and its seemingly ever-expansive grip, have bubbled over repeatedly these past months. Protesters and Police have clashed endlessly, with the ferocity of violence escalating over time.

The political dissonance between Hong Kong and mainland China is represented in the differences between their digital worlds. In China many social media and large-scale digital communications outlets, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, are banned completely, while other internet traffic is strained through various 'word smart' vetting and censorship systems -- the social media that is allowed to exist only occupies a half life of 'scrubbed-clean' posts floating in a monitored cyberspace.

An article in the New York Times written by Paul Mozur and Lin Qiqing titled "Hong Kong Takes Symbolic Stand Against China's High-Tech Controls" summatively unpacks these tensions, as they write, "'One country, two systems' — the shorthand to describe China's and Hong Kong's separate governance structures — has brought with it one country, two internets." What is also described over the course of the article is the fear felt by those who know the feeling of an unfettered internet -- and know what there is to be lost. They write,

_The semiautonomous city's proximity to a society that is increasingly closed off and controlled by technology has informed protesters' concerns about Hong Kong's future. For many, one fear is the city will fall into a shadow world of surveillance, censorship and digital controls that many have had firsthand experience with during regular travels to China._

Protesters stormed the legislative council of Hong Kong in July and defaced it in an act of defiance against what they see as a puppet government of China. In Foreign Affairs periodical, an article written by Clay Shirky titled _The Political Power of Social Media_ explicates some of the complications that come with using social media as a catalyst for organizing activism. He writes,

_The use of social media tools -- text messaging, e-mail, photo sharing, social networking, and the like -- does not have
a single preordained outcome. Therefore, attempts to outline their effects on political action are too often reduced to
dueling anecdotes...  they have the most dramatic effects in states where a public sphere already constrains the actions of the government._ 

The significance of the last passage speaks, for this instance, most alarmingly. The fear for many of these protesters lies in the fact that, were their government to shift towards such a 'shadow-surveillance' state, they would then be caused to lose the tools of assembly and organization integral to the people's means to protest at all. For many protesters, they feel as if this is their last chance.

Technology's complex role in these conflicts is perhaps the most integrated to date in the history of civil unrest -- it is inseparable from the cause of the conflict, inseparable from its end, and from each instance of violence and destruction. The most common incarnation of this is represented by the CCTV camera -- a watchful eye of governance and identification. These cameras are the most significant symbols of an expanding regime; thus rendering them most popular targets for protesters. According to _Comparitech_, as of August 19th, 2019, 8 out of the top 9 most-surveilled cities by CCTV are located in China, with the second-most cameras in the world occupying Shenzhen – 1 929 600 cameras for 12 128 721 people, or 159.09 cameras per 1 000 people. Shenzhen, of course, being the mainland Chinese city closest to Hong Kong (having only the 26th-most CCTV cameras).

The same _New York Times_ article provided the perspective of one protester, who explained the destruction of cameras as such, 

_“Before, Hong Kong wouldn't be using cameras to surveil citizens. To destroy the cameras and the [smart] lampposts is a symbolic way to protest,” said Stephanie Cheung, a 20-year-old university student and protester who stood nearby as others bashed the lens out of a dome camera at a subway stop last month. “We are saying we don't need this surveillance.”

“Hong Kong, step by step, is walking the road to becoming China,” she said._

Smashing is not the only response to the cameras -- protesters also commonly use swathes of umbrellas to protect their actions and identities from government surveillance. Individuals also have been using paint and laser pointers to interfere with cameras, in addition to covering their faces. This seems for good reason, as Mozur and Qiqing write,

_Privacy concerns on both sides have driven efforts to maintain real-life anonymity. Police officers have stopped wearing badges with names or numbers. Protesters have covered their faces with masks. Both sides are carrying out increasingly sophisticated attempts to identify the other online._

Not only is physical technology extremely significant to this conflict, but also the concept of the digital self -- the self represented in the online impression made by soldiers from either side of the war. In a recent development in the protests, as of October 4th, an article published by QUARTZ writes, the city has invoked an emergency-powers law from the 'colonial era' in order to ban facemasks at protests. An offender can face a large fine or imprisonment up to one year. The intent of the law is clear -- attempts to resist the system of surveillance will not be tolerated. Your physical self belongs to you, but your digital self, represented in data about what you did, where you were, what you said in a message to somebody else; these all belong to the system itself, the state.

I think that this passage in Shirky's article accurately describes the mechanics of the conflict. It reads as follows,

_Political freedom has to be accompanied by a civil society literate enough and densely connected enough to discuss the issues presented to the public... As with the printing press, the Internet spreads not just media consumption but media production as well -- it allows people to privately and publicly articulate and debate a welter of conflicting views._

In conclusion, the system that is built to own the digital selves of its citizens cannot be confronted. It cannot be reasoned with, nor does it possess the capacity for compromise. It may only be submitted to or else resisted. The rapid proliferation of technology may provide the opportunity for these vast systems to be built, but the choice lays with the people to fall into line with the system, or to do otherwise.
