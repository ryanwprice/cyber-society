“Heaps of cringe” are the first words that
appear in my head upon mention of the video-sharing app TikTok. Even if my own
opinions on the app are insufficiently informed (my first-hand experience is
limited to what I can bare to see) I have yet to meet a single person in real
life who openly uses TikTok or genuinely enjoys the sort of content that its
users produce. While its popularity and merit may seem invisible to me, the
platform is among 2019’s most downloaded apps, and is only continuing to grow. With
the general consensus holding that the app is a powerhouse of eye-roll-worthy
content, I find TikTok’s success to be utterly confounding. The social media
video platform was the subject of an article in The New Yorker magazine, titled
“The Meme Factory: How TikTok holds our attention.” In the article, author Jia
Tolentino investigates the online cultures which give rise to apps like TikTok.
Tolentino’s observations gave me a greater understanding of the phenomena
behind TikTok’s success, as well as a greater understanding of why I and so
many others find TikTok content to be so repulsive.

One of the first observations Tolentino makes about TikTok is that it is a platform best represented by a
young teenage consumer contingent - specifically those who fall into the “gen
Z” category. She describes TikTok videos as “the natural expressions of kids
who’d had smartphones since they were in middle school, or elementary school.” As
a university student, maybe the reason it seems like no one likes TikTok is
because I don’t spend any time around its main demographic of high school kids.
While the gap may only be a narrow on, me and my peers grew up on an internet
that was much clunkier than the one that raised today’s tenth-graders, and that
difference is everything. If a child’s physical environment has everything to
do with their development, how much of an impact can changes in a digital
culture have?

            Prior to reading Tolentino’s
article, I had no knowledge of how the app actually worked. I had merely
assumed it to be a more evolved older cousin of lip-sync-style apps like
musical.ly and Dubsmash. As it turns out, TikTok’s defining feature is not the
mode or method of content creation that it allows its users, but the way in
which content is shown to them. Tolentino explains that unlike other social
media platforms which allow users to curate their feed of content by way of
following or “friending” other accounts, TikTok’s feed is entirely algorithm
driven. Through video recognition technology, posts are analyzed and linked to
other videos that might contain similar content. The algorithm picks up on the
user’s engagement with specific types of posts and gives them more of the sort
of posts they seem to be most “addicted” to. As Tolentino puts it: “TikTok
doesn’t ask you to pretend you’re on the internet for a good reason […] I was
giving TikTok my attention because it was serving me what would retain my
attention.” 

To locate precisely where the difference lies
between myself and people who enjoy TikTok content, things need to get a little
spiritual. Millennial humour is often described as being heavily based on irony
and self-satire, with internet memes being a primary medium. At this point,
most of us intuitively understand the nuances of what will make a given
reference funny or lame. Given the reflexive nature of memetic humour, the joke
will always be in reaction to something, and this is not a problem - the ‘dao’
of irony permits dead horses to be bludgeoned so long as it is done correctly.
The problem arises when the joke is made in reaction to other people reacting
to the subject of the joke. The awkward kid in elementary school playgrounds regurgitating
lines memorised from a joke book is the same kid who we might now see typing “this
ain’t it chief” on Instagram hoping to get top comment. This sort of approval
seeking is a primary explanation for the downright cringiness of so many TikTok
videos. Tolentino observes “In the teleology of TikTok, humans were put on
earth to make good content, and ‘good content’ is anything that is shared,
replicated and built upon. In essence, the platform is an enormous meme
factory, compressing the world into pellets of virality.” This ethos that is a
fundamental part of TikTok’s design almost forces users into the sorts of
behaviour I am describing. TikTok feeds users a gauntlet of videos that are
structured around classifiable trends (like dances, mini-narratives, or lip
syncing sound bites) which are then meant to be replicated by those who view
them. At this point, there are probably thousands of videos of people “hitting
the whoa” to the same several seconds of music. When trends like these catch
on, people start participating just to “get in on the action,” seeking approval
from the crowd. It seems to me that TikTok is structured in a way that
encourages and normalizes the production of content that exemplifies this
behaviour – akin to bad film sequels and gratuitous collaborative music
projects.

Being an attention-based platform makes TikTok
a natural place for marketers, who desire as many eyes as possible for maximum
exposure. Naturally, marketers would gravitate towards such a platform, seeking
as many eyes as possible for maximum exposure. While TikTok is still a
relatively new platform, there is already industrial infrastructure surrounding
the creation of TikTok content for the purpose of monetization. In the article,
Tolentino details her interactions with CEOs leading entire teams focussing on
advancing business using TikTok. I found it astounding that such grand-scale
production was being organized around silly fifteen second videos filmed with a
smartphone camera. Aspiring musicians have seen fit to market their music on
TikTok. Some even admit that they have crafted their songs in ways meant to
find success on the app. TikTok has spawned a whole new internet culture and
market that function within the app’s own bubble. While TikTok provides plenty
of opportunity for monetization, the effects are felt in the rest of culture as
tastes of emerging generations are being formed by the modes of content created
for the platform, and unlike its predecessor lip-sync apps like Triller and
Musical.ly, TikTok shows no signs of going away any time soon.
