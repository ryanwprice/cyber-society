# Why YouTube is Crushing Cable T.V.

In Lorenzo Ligato's article, YouTube Is Crushing Cable TV, According To Google, Ligato discusses how since 2015, YouTube has reached more 18-49 year-olds (has had a larger audience) then any U.S cable network. Which has led me to think, "why?" To help me answer this question I'm going to be examining it through the lens of Marshall McLuhan's, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, with a focus on his ever famous saying "the medium is the message." That saying poses interesting questions for the age of online video. In McLuhan's time, the great shift in media was from print to electronic media (radio and television). Where the printed book was what he called "hot media" - an intense, one way, offloading of high definition information into your mind. TV on the other hand, was cool (cold media) - it was low definition, on in a busy house, interrupted by commercials, playing to all the minds senses. In other words, it demanded your participation to fill in the gaps. Every kind of media, from print to radio, to music, to television, to the internet, creates an invisible environment around us - when you're watching TV you may be aware of the particular show you're watching; how funny, or how engaging it is, or how much you relate to the characters, but rarely do we perceive or step back to understand what it actually means to watch TV, what it means to be in that audio/visual, immersive sensory environment.

It's no surprise that the great triumph of television is advertising, but what could possibly be more attuned to the medium of television than commercials: In 30 seconds or a minute they invite or require participation while triggering each and every one of our senses. Just as early television took its cues from print, radio, and film, before coming into its own, online videos have taken its cues from TV. But like TV at its release, online video is a wholly new medium, operating in its own environment, reshaping our consciousness once again. The way we watch online videos is different; we're close up to the screens, transfixed, but the screens are small, often the size of a cellphone. Whereas my hand is rarely on the remote control, it's nearly always on the mouse, inviting different kinds of agencies, like the ease at which you can scan through a video, examples like this, among others, have effects on the styles that become widely viewed and adopted amongst this medium - like the need for content creators to keep their videos fast paced. But I think the largest ingredient of online video is the awareness that every consumer is a potential creator. The appeal of lo-fi, the idea of making something that, potentially anybody could produce is extremely important to the culture of online video, so much so that what's considered flawed and imperfect videography in the eyes of other media, is actually essential to online video. 

McLuhan was fond of saying that radio was more suited to packages, to completed products. While TV had a preoccupation with processes, to see how things were done. I think this extends even further with online video, just take a look at daily vlogs, perhaps the form thatâ€™s most tailored to the medium of online video. The process of filming your day, of how the camera moves, it's vital to the concept. Good, valuable content for online video has to be matched with a style that fits the medium. Of course, it's still very early in the history of this medium, in 10 or 20 years with a better perspective we'll be able to look back at all of this work and point back to the first true masterpieces of the medium. But what's exciting now is that those of us that are working in online video are, in effect, creating the form. We're writing the language of this new medium. And for that reason, experimentation and innovation have to continue to be a top priority. And even for those who just watch, it's essential to study this medium as it grows, to be aware of its message and the unique environment it creates, because "all aspects of the media have an irresistible force when invisible."
