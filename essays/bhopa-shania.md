There is a growing interest in the usage of social media, and its hindering affects to our adolescent population. With 1 billion users on Instagram, 52% of them being female, we must consider the cognitive effects with the increased usage of this platform (Instagram, 2019). In an article published by the New York Times, Jane Michel argues; there are unrealistic media messages regarding body image negatively disturbing heavy users (Michel, 2016). As a twenty-one year old avid social media user, I believe that my self esteem takes a toll from the content that I view daily.This editorial analyzes the way Instagram negatively affects adolescent females self esteem, and the various tactics we can put into practice to make change. 

Jane Michels Point of View
Jane Michel’s article introduces that way social media possesses the ability to negatively affect our mental health. Michel states that the content on a platform like Instagram, is filled with images of females editing their photos to make themselves dangerously thin (Michel, 2016). Michel states that before social media, teenagers could avoid the barrage of body negativity, as their only means of viewing such content would be through magazines and advertisements (Michel, 2016). However, teens are found using various editing apps to distort, airbrush and filter their bodies (Michel, 2016). Michel argues that teens try to make themselves appear “perfect” and as close to the thin ideal that is portrayed through various Instagram models, and celebrities (Michel, 2016).  

Evidence
Body image is defined as ones attitudinal disposition towards the physical self which includes evaluation, cognitive and behavioural components (Ahadzadeh, Sharif & Ong, 2017). Idealized images possess the ability to cause young adolescent females to evaluate their appearance by comparing themselves to others to learn to define their own characteristics (Ahadzadeh, Sharif & Ong, 2017). Social media sites provide for meticulous self presentation, allowing users to selectively allow content on their profiles and strategically construct personas, emphasizing our most desirable traits (Mackson, Brochu & Schneider, 2019). As mentioned in the Marwick and Boyd text users present themselves in a positive light hiding various real events that may occur, because their best self is the only self they wish to display to the world (Marwick & Boyd, 2011). This idea that you must present your best self on social media, can force female teens to critically analyze every aspect of their life, forcing unhealthy habits to arise. There is constant need to compare yourself to your friends and peers while striving for this “ideal” body that is presented on Instagram. I believe posting photographs force viewers to seek out the most aesthetically pleasing, and perfect shots to cater to their followers desires. 
An article titled “My Selfie, Myself.” described the epidemic of self portraits flooding the internet, abetted by the explosion of cell phone cameras and photo editing (Wortham, 2013).This text forces me to understand that the prevalence of skewed self presentation is bigger than ever with the attribution of selfies. People are wrestling with how they appear to the rest of the world, and this constant comparison is unhealthy (Wortham, 2013). An interesting point made in the Containing Multitudes text by Mills Baker “online spaces become zones of culture conflict which we must judge and be judged” (Baker, n.d.). Bakers point can be used to understand that the social networks we are apart of, have specific ideologies and that while judging our followers posts, we are subject to judgement as well. It is essential that we understand part of the reason females are undergoing negative mental health and self schema, it is associated with the worry that their posts will be judged by their followers. This creates an internal stress one may possess. 

Recommendations
As social networking sites definitely help adolescents meet new friends and stay connected with their peers, we must understand the way we present ourselves online can be detrimental to our self perception. As a frequent Instagram user I believe adolescents need to have a better understanding of our relationships between social media and mental health. Michel states “80% of women experience body negativity on social media” (Michel, 2016). We must take action and understand this high percentage is creating a population of young adolescent women with negative body image, and self perception. 
Michel listed a few suggestions on how we can stop the epidemic of idealized photos on Instagram and promote a positive space Instagram. The power is within you. The first step is to think critically of the image and never take a photo at face value (Michel, 2016). Secondly, verify that you are viewing images with a close eye and understand what photos look like when photoshopped, this will allow you to understand the difference between realistic photographs and those that are not. Thirdly, get inspired by content produced by body positive role models (Michel, 2016). It may be a bit more difficult to find these inspiring individuals, however once you do, your time on social media will promptly be more productive. We highlight the negatives that the photographic content on social media can be detrimental to one's mental health and self esteem, however it is the way in which we use these images can determine its effects. 

Conclusion
While using Instagram make sure you are not placing emphasis on influencers and  celebrities that pop up on your feed. Do not analyze, do not compare, do not promote the heavily airbrushed photos that promote unrealistic body ideals. Jane Michel raised impactful points within her article and I hope that teens across North America take the recommendations listed and implement them. Instagram is such a good tool for peers to connect with one another, yet we are flooding our feeds with useless content creating a negative space. I am determined to use the sources evaluated proactively, and focus on the images that leave a positive impression.
