The **public sphere** is the centre of conversation and controversy, and thus the enabler of powerful movements. It is the pillar of global communication and awareness, and therefore acts as a device to carry the world to the next. Antonia Malchike utilizes her article titled, _The Problem with Social Media Protests_ (2019) to argue the strength held by in-person protests, as opposed to the weakness presented in online protests. She argues that protests growing on social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, have limited effect on creating policy change. The belief presented in the article explains that the short time that it takes for a movement to grow on social media, also quickly dismantles in a short time span. (Malchike, 2019) While it is true that social media trends are very quick to remain simply a trend to engage users for a short period of time, it should not go without recognition that many of the largest recent protests engaging the international community, were organized through social media. The annual International Women’s March to protest for women’s rights was a movement completely organized through social media. The international Climate Change strike, was also a movement started on social media. Ideas exchanged via the internet educated individuals worldwide and brought millions together to step up and call for action and change in policy. Furthermore, the widespread of communication through online mediums caught the attention of public figures who’s societal hierarchy hold immense influence on mainstream values. Today’s public sphere exists primarily on social media and as a result is the leading tool for activism and protest towards policy change. Evidently, this is seen through the differentiation between trends and movements, international protests organized on social media, and influential engagement by public figures on social media. 

**#hashtags** have become the most important element of in-discriminatory online conversation. Language barriers no longer serve as an excuse against international calls for action, as #hashtags across online platforms used by anyone can cause for an eruption of awareness on policy-change-worthy topics. One thing that is a must to recognize in digital civics is contrasting powers of social media trends versus social media movements. Malchike's claims underestimate the longevity of social media protests as she argues, “New eras of protest will have to learn how to combine the ease and speed of online connectivity with the long-term face-to-face organizing that gives physical protest its strength and staying power.” (Malchike, 2019) It’s striking that enough research nor awareness of the global community were not taken into consideration, as many protests have surpassed the phase of a social media “trend”; trend (_verb_) is defined as something which is the

Rather, it is impressing how “speedy fast”social media sites, like Twitter can reach international news enthusiasts at unorthodox times of day, disseminating news of social change in real-time (Hounshell, 2013). The swiftness of bringing attention to a situation does not instead become a short-lived trend, but quickly organizes millions to come together to advocate and protest for change. Thus, there is more human power going towards one issue, worldwide. Not only does the power of the online public sphere work to make the global community aware, it allows for people from the far-east to the far-west to collectively advocate for issues that exist around the world. As the most powerful public sphere the world has seen yet, protests on social media have exponentially grown in terms of effectivity and productivity, as large conversation leads to overwhelming pressure on social institutions to make change.

Would you say that a protest that started on social media has little **longevity** if you could see that it exists around the world, every single year? January 21, 2017 marked the first International Women’s March, a

 to fight for ending violence, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, workers’ rights, civil rights, disability rights, immigrant rights, and environmental justice,  following the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. What began as something organized on Facebook simply for American participants, inspired a movement (different from a quick “trend”) around the world. Every continent, including Antartica had participants, totalling a count of  around 5 million marchers in the United States alone, tens of thousands per city — 60, 000 in Toronto, Canada, for a reference close to home (Vella, 2017). The next two years saw large numbers across the world again, still protesting action and empowering women’s rights around the world. And again, word was spread through social media. 

2019 became an essential year to call for action from our governments and large corporations in terms of movements towards environmental change and resistance for climate change. The end of September, 2019 saw the first ever **Global Climate Strike** which saw over 7.6 million people strike from school and work to call for better, realistic action towards saving the planet from environmental destruction (Global Climate Strike, 2019). Widespread of conversation, awareness, and organization again took place on social media platforms. The online public sphere again brought together the international community to protest, resulting in recorded 6135 actions taken, 185 countries, 73 trade unions, 3024 businesses, 820 organizations, and 8583 websites working towards a single, yet incredibly important cause (Global Climate Strike, 2019). It goes without a doubt to say that one person’s actions (Greta Thunberg, climate change activist) shared through social media, holds the ability to bring together nations and powerful figures to create global change. 

**Politicians and celebrities** were few to name that participated in the mentioned protests. Sharing of policy concerns by influential individuals, have extreme impact and apply intense pressure on policy makers. Reverting back to the importance of a public sphere — there is no better way to communicate an idea and organize physical protest, other than via social media. Everyone up to the most powerful law makers and politicians participate in online discourse  regarding how change can be achieved. Attendance in Canada’s Global Climate strike included current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,  and electoral candidate Jagmeet Singh to name a few leaders taking part in protest towards climate change effort. Furthermore, both leaders took to Twitter to continue to debate policy changes that can be made; Trudeau tweeted on the day of the strike:  

> “We’ll plant 2 billion trees over the next ten years. That’s it. That’s the tweet.”   
> (Trudeau, @JustinTrudeau, _via Twitter_, 2019)   

It is clear, that not only does social media have the power to bring together large communities, but also, allows for political leaders to engage in conversation and thus, democratically work towards meaningful change.

Facebook is used to invite friends to events, Twitter is used to discuss practically any issue, and Instagram is used to document moments, creating “stories”. It is almost absurd to undermine the capability of social media in such a digital world, in regards to policy reform and creating change. Time and time again, it becomes more and more evident, that social media is a significant **instrument in driving conversation, building awareness, and coordinating protest towards a better world.**
Living in a Western city like Toronto, it is almost unimaginable to see how a single act of protest on social media can be the root of cause and effect thousands of miles away. And, vice-versa; documentation of poor situations can be uploaded through media from across the globe, and be advocated for in my city, as a result of communication through social media. It’s safe to say, digital civics is the new wave of social activism and protest.
