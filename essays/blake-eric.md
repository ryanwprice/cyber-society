With the advancements of technology and the emergence of social media, we are becoming addicted not to the world around us, but to these apps/platforms. Is it too late to stop it or should we just buckle down and accept that this is our society now? Those find it much easier to interact online rather in person as “they are much more comfortable in their online Facebook relationships than in actually “talking” to people face-to-face” (Benjamin, 2015). Is this a call for concern, how might this impact individuals who need to be able to communicate face to face for jobs or as a society are, we just living in the moment and will worry about those problems as they arise? This addiction to social media has been emerging as of recent years especially in younger generations. We are starting to become so addicted to living the most envious lifestyle ‘online’ "there has also been a growing movement to include a psychiatric disorder with the title of Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” (Benjamin, 2015 ). It really comes down to us living the most extravagant life, showing everyone why my life is better than yours rather than living in the moment. It’s become a popularity contest, rather than just living life to the fullest which drives this social media addiction. 

Let’s break down this addiction. Addiction can be described as a compulsive behaviour that consumes your life and leads to negative effects. From a society standpoint this widespread technological addiction is sweeping the nation but all in all media in itself is very useful and impressive in what it has accomplished. So is this okay, can we not be worried about this addiction or can we just pass it as something we do when were bored. It is definitely up for debate and could be looked at in both perspectives. In one case we can see that we use social media to show creativeness and broadcast to our friends and family what is important to us. On the other hand, it can be looked at in a negative light as it can be seen like we are wasting time and losing authentic human characteristics as we feel more comfortable over our phones. This can put a numerous amount of stress on one’s self to try and be the person everyone seeks to be but may lead to further complications depending on the severity and how many platforms they use. 

In addition, do I think social media is the root of all evil, no. I do believe that people control technology and the power that it encompasses. It should not be the other way around. I think we are to blame as these “billionaire technology entrepreneurs and marketers successfully marketing their latest social media technology—especially to children and adolescents—to a point where our kids are growing up “vicariously,” i.e. being glued to their computer technology gadgets as their favourite way of passing time” ( Benjamin, 2015). This is whats wrong with the society today. We are becoming so reliant on creating the next big thing that these platforms and apps are sprouting and making it that much harder to try and kick the habit of social media addiction. 

With everything being broadcasted on social media were missing out on real life experiences which is most apparent anytime you’re in public. It seems like everyone is on their phones or taking photos of things that they think will entice their followers. Us as a society “we can't seem to enjoy something for what it is without wanting everyone to know we're enjoying it. We can't dance to the encore at our favourite band's concert because we're too busy capturing it for our snap story, to make sure that people know we're doing something exciting. We can't dig into a beautiful meal before snapping pictures of it first, to make sure that people know we are something delicious” (Benjamin, 2015). So is this what our world has come too or can we blame this on this addiction. It truly does make you think has social media impacted us in the wrong way. With all these advancements in the technological realm are we actually taking steps backwards or is it making us more aware of how easy it is to be consumed by social media.

We have social media at the click of a button. It is so accessible you are connected in some way, somehow 365 days a year 24 hours a day. It is very easy to fall victim to social media as many of the younger generations have. An essay written by Elliot Benjamin a philosopher who studies humanistic and transpersonal psychology states “we are always connected, yet so fragmented. While becoming increasingly connected we are becoming disconnected from ourselves. Because of the social media epidemic, it is also my observation that time spent among friends is overshadowed by agendas. It often feels contrived and staged. Social media breeds and feeds shallow connections, and I find myself hungry for deeper, more meaningful connections now more than ever. We are starving ourselves while gorging on our incessant compulsion to perform (Benjamin, 2015). This ties into social media being the driving force for our lives and this compulsion to make our followers envious of our lifestyle. Having this online personality is looked at as an addiction which leads us into something that was spoken about in several media classes. 

Social media has made it readily available for influencers to impact how we view a ‘complete’ profile. A life that everyone strives to obtain. This is why social media addiction can be manipulated to make something that may or may not be real but you desperately want to acquire. In conclusion social media is the forefront to most of the world and how we gain information and broadcast our lives publicly through these platforms. Social media can be a great thing to an extent. But in reality, plays an unhealthy habit in a majority of individuals lives that ultimately can lead to a social media addiction or much, much worse.
