It's the 21st century, and nothing, but everything, is normal. The main reason why it is so different than 20 years ago, is because of technology. Trends, cultures, and mediums are all changing people's opinions on what is ethical and what isn't, for the better, and the worse. In my essay, I will dive into  the many reasons why it should not be seen as normal or ethical for people to pull out their phones and record as much as they can at a live event. Through real life examples from comedians, personal experiences from me, and expert critiques from theorists, I believe that it should be seen as unethical to record a live event during its run-time, as it divides your full attention, which is ultimately what you are paying for.



Before I can disagree with the entire concept of recording an event, we must first realize why that is occurring. Many of these reasons revolve around getting the right shot at the best moment, to be able to see it later or show friends/family, which ultimately means that in the moment you take the video, you are not fully committed to the event you attended. Comedian Dave Chappelle was one of the first people to ban the usage of cellphones at his shows. New York Times stated "The comedian Dave Chappelle used to hate when fans would pull out smart phones during his act, record the performance and then post it on YouTube and social media before the show had even ended. To him, the fans seemed more interested in getting the perfect shot than in appreciating his stand-up routine." (Morrissey, 2016). At live events, especially ones that require the audience to be actively engaged, the performers are looking for your full attention, and that is not possible when you are looking through a screen trying to record them. It can be seen as disrespectful in some cases, as they believe that whatever you are doing on your phone is more important than them.




If the event host does not care that you are recording, it has now become a willpower issue. Do you really want to watch the event from behind your phone? Do you really want to capture only a partial amount of it in exchange to see it again from your view? I have had this experience personally, at one of the most captivating moments of my life - and I made the right decision. May 12, 2019, Game 7 of the 2019 NBA Eastern Conference Finals. During the first quarter, my friend and I's phone died, leaving us with no choice but to give the Raptor game our full attention. My friend saw it as a negative thing, as he was in the middle of texting a girl, but I saw it as a blessing in disguise. Luckily for us, my brother works at MLSE, so during halftime, we gave him our phones to charge, as he was working at fan services that night. At the start of the 4th quarter, my friend told me to go get our phones, but i rejected and told him "lets enjoy this without our phones, if any highlights happen we can just watch on social media after", and that was one of my greatest decisions this year. We were able to be fully immersed in the most nerve-racking, intense NBA game of my life, and were able to capture the greatest moment in Canada Sports history - with our eyes. Although I was not able to record the last moments of game 7, I can replay what happened in my head over and over, and will never forget it. To conclude, I was able to enjoy the greatest sporting event in my life to the fullest, because I did not try to record any bit of it.



Taking videos/photos at an event is becoming more and more popular for a reason, as it has blended into our culture. Theorist Jose Van Dijck states "we are witnessing a shift, especially among the younger
generation, towards using photography as an instrument for peer bonding
and interaction. Digitization is not the cause of this trend; instead, the
tendency to fuse photography with daily experience and communication is
part of a broader cultural transformation that involves individualization and
intensification of experience." (Van Djick, 2008). In other words, people are not only using photography to remember their experience, they are using it as a bonding tool for their social life. For example, people will take a photo the event they are at only to post to social media for 24 hours, then delete it, just to show off to their peers that they were present at the event. 



Ethics are changing. Culture is changing. It is hard to draw a line between what is right and what is wrong when it comes to attending live events, but in most cases showing respect usually means giving your full attention - at least. Using photography for any case is unethical in my opinion, as  you are proving that your device is more important than them. Comedians such as Dave Chappel are even against the usage of devices during his show, as he finds it disrespectful to him, and yourself. It is even worse if you are photographing for social use, as it proves that you are only using the event as a bonding piece, and not a personal experience. I was able to experience this first hand, at one of the greatest sporting events ever, and was glad to resist the use of photography.  In that instant that you decide to record, you are looking at the screen version of the event, rather than the real life version of it, ultimately contradicting yourself on why you went to see the event live in the first place. Overall, I believe it is stupid to pull out your phones during an event (unless its an emergency situation), as the event deserves your full attention. Hopefully after reading this, you can agree with my statement too.
