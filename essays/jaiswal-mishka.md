The advent of Instagram was ‘followed’ by the game called ‘follow vs followers’. To simply define, this was the number game wherein young adults were conscious about keeping their number of followers greater than the number of people they were following which acted as an ego boost for many. The next step of acing the ‘insta-game’ or so to say, the Insta image of these teenagers was to have as many likes on their pictures as possible. Less number of likes immediately resonated with being a snob or unable to make a mark in the popular people chart. 
Soon, this game of likes made some people ‘insta-famous’ which led to the formation of a whole new world of parallel reality engulfing and consuming these young minds. 

Given this new wave of change seen in the last 5-8 years, many researchers, psychologists, educationists expressed their concerns on the ill-effect visible in the level of confidence, personality changes and major self-image issues within people. 
Hence, in April, earlier this year, people in Canada, woke up to their Instagram feed not showing them likes on posts which initiated a frenzy among all. 

Bizarre and difficult to adjust to at first, after almost 8 months of its running, some claim to still being uncomfortable with it while others state feeling more at ease, less pressurized, less competitive and calmer when posting or even viewing posts by others. 
So, is hiding likes reducing anxiety? 

Undoubtedly, receiving likes on social media has been acting like gold stars that affirm one’s work. Be it their aesthetic skills, the photography or their own looks. And who does not like being praised? While there is nothing wrong in feeling good about oneself and basking in the glory appreciation, problems arise when people start taking their image on social media and the affirmations received more seriously than their ‘real-life’ image and identity. 
Under this new rule of hidden likes, one is still able to receive this affirmation but privately without an audience being able to see it as well. 
This helps in atleast reducing the mental health repercussions if not ruling them out completely. 

The initial blueprint of social media portals was designed to foster comparisons which thereafter sprouted out feelings of worthlessness and disdain. 
According to a study conducted in 2015, teens claimed to feel 78 per cent closer to their friends, 49 per cent more informed, 42 per cent more connected to their families and overall much more in control of their lives and personality via social media. 
But definitely, this was transient, since, in the year 2018, the same participants reported feeling pressured to only show their best version. They felt overloaded with information, overwhelmed and now suffered with the ‘fear of missing out’ or FOMO. 
(Joanne Orlando, “Instagram hiding likes could be a big deal for our mental health” The Conversation, 20th July 2019)
This timely shift of mindset is evidence of the ultimate anxiety the whole concept of likes is breeding. 

It is imperative to note that the study on increasing levels of depression and loneliness by likes is just one half of the research since there is a prevalent half of it that talks about the increase in well being and levels of self-confidence in others. The hashtag ‘Say no to body shaming’ became a huge campaign in the last two years wherein people unflinchingly posted bikini pictures of themselves and received tremendous amounts of love and ‘likes’ on theses pictures that led to many people feeling comfortable in their skins, which they were unable to achieve in real life. Since the judgement is silent and everyone wants to showcase themselves as a good person, liking these pictures and spreading positivity virtually steered a subconscious change in the way people think and perceive body beauty in the real world. 
“Instagram likes can be a powerful way of fulfilling teenagers’ desire for social belonging and approval” says Hannah Schacter, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California (Brittany Wong, An Instagram With No 'Likes' Could Have A Big Impact On Mental Health”, Huffington Post, 5th October 2019) 

The question exists, when then do things go wrong? 
There is a very fine line in feeling good about ourselves through social media and becoming way too critical and analytical about the number count, how our picture performed as compared to someone else’s. This is perhaps the part where many go wrong that has inadvertently led to the adoption of hiding likes. 

The trial of hiding likes is ongoing in seven different countries- Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand and the results are still being calculated. 

Another problem that this trial has tried to eradicate is the new forming trend of buying likes, especially done by influencers in order to commodify their page and gain more sponsorships. 
As we all know, a new career choice added as a feather to the cap called ‘millennial job options’, amidst a plethora of distinct new jobs that youngsters today pursue to earn millions is being- an Instagram influencer. To become an influencer, an Instagram user posts pictures, blogs, videos etc. related to a specific field of content namely- travel, food, makeup, fashion, philosophy and much more. Once they are able to garner followers in high numbers and the audience can trust their content and recommendations, companies big and small sponsor as well as pay these influencers to endorse their products. In simpler terms, these commoners turned social media celebrities are no less than highly paid actors who endorse the same brands on television and other media making the world of Instagram a wholesome marketing and advertising portal benefitting both the brand and the influencer in earning a living. 
Companies choose their influencers based on whether their content resonates with the product and if their audience engages well with them. This engagement is monitored through the number of likes their posts receive which in turn acts as the biggest factor for the brands to choose one influencer over the other. Perhaps, with the exit of likes, this monitoring has become difficult, which is making the hiring of influencers more tedious than before. Since the engagement cannot be checked, companies are becoming dubious about hiring them and spending money on social media promotions. 

“Moreover, A recent research survey of Canadian influencers by #paid, a platform connecting brands with creators, found that more than half of influencers affected by the Instagram test have seen the number of likes drop on their posts. Over 50% of surveyed influencers have seen the growth of their follower counts slowed.” (Paige Leskin, “No audience applause at the end of a performance”, Business Insider, 5th September 2019) 
Creators are complaining that “If likes aren't seen, people are less likely to 'like' thinking this is irrelevant." (“An Instagram without likes, #paid, 2019) 
But, while it is evident that the hiding of likes is impacting a huge space of business, it should also be noted that since social media marketing has become more important than other mediums, the chances of it dying down are less. Therefore, the difficulty being faced by the market right now might only be short-lived and revive soon after people get used to this trial and this new way of functioning of social media. 

Overall, it is fair to say, that this new development is definitely a pivotal step that has affected and transformed the very meaning of social media. Though the change seems to be for the good it will be interesting to witness the results unfold in the long run!
