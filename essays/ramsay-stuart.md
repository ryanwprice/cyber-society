#Crowdsourcing Justice
##Stuart Ramsay

In today’s society technology has made its way into every part of people’s lives. With technology advancing faster than the eye can see, it is no wonder many wish to utilize it in new ways to protect themselves. However, are these apps designed to keep people safe truly beneficial to humanity? Safe Lanes is an application that crowdsources its data from cyclists all around the world creating an ever-updating map that showcases any potential hazards blocking their path. The app also lets users take pictures of any vehicle’s license plate and using a license plate reader, it automatically fills out a complaint form and sends it to the city’s non-emergency 311 services. With applications like Safe Lanes, the question of how much power should a single citizen wields in the palm of their hands lingers.


With many large corporations cashing in on these applications, many ethical questions arise as to how much faith should we put into these applications? To start off, 34% of burglars enter homes through the front door.[1] With this statistic in mind, it’s no wonder many people wish to add smart home functionality to keep them protected. That’s where ‘Ring’ enters the ring. Owned by Amazon, ‘Ring’ is a smart home and security company that offers a variety of different products with their prominent item being the smart doorbell. This doorbell isn’t your typical doorbell, it detects motion and then sends you a notification in which you can then see, hear, and speak to whoever is on the other side of your door.[2] The abundance of features provides many with an assurance of safety no matter where they may be. However, this seemingly innocent doorbell hides many secrets behind closed doors. Recently Amazon has begun listing job postings searching for a ‘Managing Editor’ with the task of "work[ing] on an exciting new opportunity within Ring to manage a team of news editors who deliver breaking crime news alerts to our neighbors.”[3] This job offer sheds light on how Ring is utilizing fear as a primary selling point to increase their sales. Alarmingly, a new product called ‘Neighbours’ was released with the sole purpose of recreating a neighbourhood watch digitally. Ring is profiting off of the fear of its customers that it generated itself along with the crowdsourcing through its new app Neighbours. With most large corporations being concerned with their own profits, the last thing that’ll ring our doorbells is safety.


As technology becomes more and more integrated into our daily lives, a major question that must be addressed is how important is the right to privacy? With apps like Safe Lanes, safety seems to be the number one concern and for good reason. In Canada alone, 890 cyclists[4] died between 2006 and 2017 as a result of getting into an accident while cycling. So it stands to reason that safety should be a high priority and apps that both encourage and enforce the laws to protect cyclists should be embraced. But does the safety of an individual override the privacy of many? The Safe Lanes app collects license plate numbers which can potentially be used to target and deport immigrants. Rachel Thomas, a founding director of Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco’s Data Institute, and the co-founder of the online coding school Fast.ai perfectly encapsulates the way in which society has begun developing in recent years when she states, “There’s been this cultural shift of normalizing that it’s okay to be taking photos and videos of other people in public,”[5] With the advent of smartphones and wearable technology, society’s relationship with technology is slowing becoming a symbiotic relationship and the first thing that is being discarded is privacy.  It is vital that apps like Safe Lanes and Ring have clear rules enforced to prevent any breaches of privacy otherwise the future is going to be a lot closer to 1984 than we hope. 


With every year that passes, the machines we hold dear to our hearts evolve alongside us for better or worse. With these evolutions come new ways to interact with both our digital and physical worlds. Using the Safe Lanes app as an example, cyclists now have an all in one app that tactfully uses crowdsourcing to report any hazards on a live map, ultimately creating a safer place for everyone. The app also has the ability to analyze the photo taken and extract a vehicle’s license plate automatically and then send a complaint form to your city’s non-emergency number.[6] On paper, the concept of being able to quickly snap a picture or shoot a video of any potential vehicles that may be blocking your way sounds perfect, with the added bonus of some justice being served. But arguably the biggest hazard, in this case, isn’t a vehicle in your path but rather the malicious ways this app can be used. Safety apps might provide us with a sense of protection but it also gives rise to a self-surveillance society. This tattle-tale civilization breeds vigilantism and witch-hunting. Both of these issues have extreme repercussions that do more harm than good. For this app to be in the best interest of mankind it would need to shift its focus off of snitching and create a larger focus on pointing out the hazards on the map. By removing the self-policing element the app would be a niche alternative to popular map apps, ultimately protecting more people in the process.

Overall, these safety applications seem to pose more of a safety risk than what they claim to protect. With apps like Ring and Safe Lanes having untrustworthy owners, it’s hard to entrust your safety if the company doesn’t care about you. On a similar note, these apps pose major privacy risks for the unsuspecting general public. Lastly, build off of that last point, these security apps specifically promote vigilantism creating a hostile environment of self-surveillance. Many of the risks involved with these safety apps seem to harm the public as a whole more so than the individuals it protects. So the biggest question is whether or not the benefits outweigh the consequences.
