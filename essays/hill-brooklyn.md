 There is a popular trend among many teens and young adults that has been kept on the “down-low”. This trend is to create a fake Instagram account, also known as a finstagram or finsta. I know of many people in and around my age group who have these special accounts, the thing is, I do not know the kind of content that a number of them post. 
 These finstagrams are separate accounts from their main Instagram accounts, which are private so that only a select group can view the content within. These accounts “capture something rarely seen by people who follow these same users on their main accounts: reality” (Safronova, 2015). 

 Maybe these accounts should be referred to as a rinstagram instead, for “real” Instagram. The social rules and principles of Instagram are more-so ignored within these fake accounts (Safronova, 2015). This reflects the idea that photographs today, are increasingly used to express an individual’s sense of identity and personality, along with being an interesting method of communication (Van Dijck, 2008). I think the main aspect of these separate accounts is that the content is very unfiltered, often seen as entertaining and funny, and often personal. I bet if you were to ask anyone with a finstagram if they would allow someone such as their parent or an employer if they could scroll through their posts, most of them would definitely be strongly against that idea. From my personal perspective, the majority will not even feel comfortable allowing people that they do in fact know, but aren’t too close with, follow that account. This was also expressed in the article by Valeriya Safronova, where a student discussed that she was debating whether or not to accept someone that she recently met to follow her account (2015). She also stated that that made her “really think” about the kind of things she was posting on that account (Safronova, 2015). I feel that many finstagram users need to think about what they post on a certain level, and that just because what they post is within a private account, doesn’t mean that the content within is completely secure and safe from all eyes and perspectives.

 I think that these accounts can be used in a positive way, if used correctly. They could become a creative outlet to share a “goofy” side of yourself with your closest friends. I know of people who use these secondary accounts primarily to post more frequently and not feel subjected to the underlying social rules that come with their main accounts. In a sense, these finstagram accounts can be used as a larger collection of memories. For example, maybe a photo was taken of a fun adventure with your friends but you don’t think the quality of it “fits” with your main account’s feed or aesthetic.. so then you upload it to your finstagram where you are not worried about a certain theme or even the feedback that it receives. All things that many people usually think about on their main accounts. Instead it is simply there for memories sake, being sort of a catalogue of moments that you would like to look back on from time to time and still be sharing with people that are closest to you. For reasons along those lines, I would be completely supportive of a second account. However, I know that this is not exactly the case for the content of some users’ finstagrams. 

 Large issues can lie within these accounts. The collection of photos that are there contain a wide source of information and, in a way, they each have a story to tell (Van Dijck, 2008). Whether or not the posts relay and tell a safe story and information is the owner’s responsibility. That content network holds heavy power that can hold truths and lies (Van Dijck, 2008), which could easily be subject to future issues, on a personal or wide-range scale. Some finsta account owners still have the mindset of a certain extent of a filter is needed when posting anything online, no matter the privacy settings that encompass it, however some do not. Certain unfiltered content mixed with the power of social media, is a risky partnership.

 Depending on what type of content and context is being produced on these accounts, can impact one’s overall image, sometimes to a large extent. I have seen popular YouTube content creators with a large “fan base” of thousands even millions of followers through their main accounts and channels, who's finstagrams get hacked and secret, exclusive content from within gets shared publicly. And dealing with the “carefreeness” and unfiltered ideology behind some, if not all of the posts on the account, many people can view the content as offensive, for example, and that negative perspective can be quickly spread via multiple social media platforms, having lasting impacts on those popular creators/influencers. This even causes people to question the true self of the account owner, comparing who they appear to be on their main accounts in contrast.

 It really makes you wonder how different some people are specifically on Instagram in comparison to how they are in real life, since there is such a contrast between most main accounts and finstagrams. Especially since most people follow a great number of people who they do not personally know, such as social media influencers, where the only perception that you have of those individuals is through what they post on their main Instagram accounts, which are most commonly highly filtered to only show the best parts about themselves and their lives, knowing that it is viewed by a larger audience. This is an analysis that could branch off further to discuss the importance of not comparing yourself to larger social media presences, as well as the factor that age may play and certain aspects of maturity levels especially being how these secondary accounts are primarily owned and created by young adults, mainly teenagers. Overall, this leaves me with the question of, do you really know someone if you don’t follow their finsta account?
