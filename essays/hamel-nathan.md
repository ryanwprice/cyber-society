### The Evolution of Exercise in an Increasingly Digital World
It seems that no matter how physically fit a person appears to be, everyone seems to have the same goal: to exercise more in hopes of improving their health. There’s a reason not all of us have the physique of a professional bodybuilder; it is difficult to create and execute a workout regimen for an extended period of time. A common strategy is to implement incentives and punishments in order to motivate oneself to stick to a plan. A new approach has emerged that attempts to make exercise more enjoyable for the participant. In Signe Brewster’s New York Times article “Virtual Reality Video Games That Double as Exercise”, she explains some of the benefits of using virtual reality to keep people disciplined and engaged in their exercise (Brewster 2019). While public opinion may disagree, when used properly technology is a net benefit to the health of human beings as a whole.
	
First, the progression of wearable technology such as FitBit and the Apple watch has allowed users to become more acquainted with useful information such as calories burned, heart rate, steps taken, and sleeping patterns. Knowledge is power, and by being more informed of these things users can work smarter in order to improve them. By knowing how many calories you are burning in a given day, you get a better idea of how many calories you need to intake to maintain energy and weight. In learning more about your sleep patterns, you know how many hours of quality sleep you are getting, and how much time you spend in each stage of sleep. People can put an immense amount of effort into improving their health, however educating themselves and putting the work into the right channels can allow for greater improvements. In her editorial published by The Hearing Journal, Deborah Price explains the matter in this way:
>One audiologist may see an average of 38 hearing aid candidates per month, with 50 percent of those patients choosing to move forward. Another audiologist may see an average of 21 hearing aid candidates per month, with 85 percent of those patients choosing to move forward. So which one is working harder? Both are able to achieve $1 million in annual revenue, but one has to work almost twice as hard to achieve the same results. Effectiveness is the key to working smarter. (Price 2012)

Price’s analogy can be applied to numerous other scenarios in life. If one person exercises six days per week but only three of them use full effort and are effective, while another person exercises four days per week and they are all effective, which one is working harder? Technology can be used to learn to do the right exercises and help you focus your effort into the right areas.

Next, the benefit of technology in the healthcare realm is undeniable. The developments made in machinery and equipment has saved countless lives and vastly improved numerous others. In an article published by The American Institute of Medical Sciences and Education, Bianca Banova outlines a few benefits of improved technology in the medical field. These include: The digitalization of health records, greater patient care, improved public health, ease of workflow, and lower healthcare costs. Banova says:
>Entering data into a computerized system is much less time-consuming than paper-based methods, and it reduces the risk of errors in patient data and financial details. Accessing patient records digitally also allows medical coding experts to work from home, increasing efficiency and productivity. (Banova 2019)

Banova speaks to the logistics of entering patient information into a digitized system, which is only one aspect of the benefits that modern technology has brought into the medical realm. The actual machinery that is used for surgeries and other procedures has certainly evolved a significant amount in the last century. Surgeries have become far less invasive and recovery times have decreased drastically. In an article for Imaging Technology News, Dave Fornell describes the changes that MRI machines have seen in recent years:
>The most recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology have been on the software side, enabling faster contrast scans, greatly simplified cardiac imaging workflows, and allowing MR scans of the lungs. In addition, a few new MRI scanners have entered the market in the past year. (Fornell 2016)

All of these improvements are resulting in healthier patients, and in some cases, lives that have been saved. Medical machinery, especially those used in hospitals and surgical centers, have been a tremendous benefit to the health of all human beings.

Next, the rise of social media has increased the awareness for, and effort being put into specialized workout plans and demonstrational videos. It has become fairly common to see someone on Instagram or Twitter posting videos of them working out in an attempt to educate and motivate their followers to do the same. For those struggling to find a place to start when exercising, these accounts could be a useful tool in developing some sort of plan. In her article “Click for fitness; Are personal trainers being replaced by online coaches?” published in Gale Academic Onefile, Danielle Barron argues that social media trainers have become more popular due to a new human lifestyle:
>Siobhan O'Hagan, personal trainer and social media influencer with over 90,000 followers on Instagram, says online coaching, a relatively new phenomenon, is becoming more common due to social media and the popularity of the 'laptop lifestyle'. She admits it has helped her dramatically expand her business … For me, it has meant I am able to coach more people in the same amount of time than if I was on the floor doing personal training with one person for one hour. (Barron 2017)

People have become dependent on their phones or other devices for a large portion of their lives; using technology to gain insight on exercise is just one more thing people are now using social media for. Social media, when being used for exercise purposes, certainly is beneficial to those who commit to using it properly.  

To conclude, there have been numerous advancements in technology and social media that have created immense benefit in the health and medical sphere. There are certainly right and wrong ways to use this technology, but when it is used correctly it is without a doubt a net positive to the health of human beings as a whole. It will be interesting to see how technology develops in the next few decades and how it can further aid the health and well being of our society.
