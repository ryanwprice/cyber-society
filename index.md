## Preface

We spend our lives online. As [Wilson Minor](https://vimeo.com/build) questioned: "What's your time to screen in the morning? How long does it take you go from dead asleep to being in front of a screen?"

So much of our day is inundated by the screen. We check the weather, update our calendar, hail a ride, share with friends (and strangers), buy our groceries, and so much more with our phones, tablets, and laptops. This seemingly endless stream of online activity creates a digital exhaust that is unfathomable to most people using the Internet today. We create a digital version of ourself with the things we intentionally post—tweets, pictures, Likes—and the things we don't realize we share—geolocation, purchasing habits, website visits, and more. Even when we try to be anonymous we leave a vapour trail of data in our wake. 
It takes as little as [15 pieces](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/health/data-privacy-protection.html) of inconsequential data about you to make you identifiable, and data brokers and social media sites can have dozens, if not thousands, of data points about you (whether you are using their site or not).

When companies have this much data and so much control over the channels we choose to use to communicate online, it leaves them with the ability and potential to influence our daily lives by manipulating our emotional stability or even the policies and people that govern our country. Ultimately, without proactive and educated online users, the Internet can be a dangerous place that leaves us with the option to simply _trust_ the companies we interact with online will do no evil.

This journal explores digital culture, exploring image, social media, and how we fit into the online world. The students of MMEDIA 3B03: Digital Cultures have considered not only the technical underpinnings and infrastructure of these digital cultures, but also their political, legal, and social dimensions, exploring how our lives are impacted by the things we see and do online.
